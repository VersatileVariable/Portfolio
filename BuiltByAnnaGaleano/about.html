										<h1>About Me</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<h2>Welcome!</h2>
									<p>I'm Anna Galeano, a Computer Science student at <strong>Clemson University</strong> with a passion for bridging the gap between cutting-edge artificial intelligence and human needs. My work focuses on <strong>human-AI teaming</strong>, autonomous systems, and privacy-preserving technologies.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Background</h2>
									<p>Growing up as a bilingual military child (English & German), I developed a unique perspective on adaptability, cross-cultural communication, and problem-solving. My experiences navigating different environments and cultures have deeply influenced my approach to technology—creating systems that are not only technically sophisticated but also genuinely serve human needs across diverse contexts.</p>
									
									<p>In 2024, I was honored to receive the <strong>Military Child of the Year</strong> award, recognizing my academic achievements, leadership, and community service. I also earned an <strong>AP Capstone Diploma</strong>, which honed my research and critical thinking skills early in my academic journey.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Research Focus</h2>
									<p>My research interests lie at the intersection of <strong>human-centered computing</strong> and <strong>autonomous systems</strong>:</p>

									<h2>Research Experience</h2>
									<p>I'm currently a researcher at the <strong>TRACE Research Group</strong> at Clemson University's School of Computing, founded by Dr. Nathan McNeese. The lab focuses on human-centered computing to enhance societies' capabilities for human-AI teamwork.</p>
									
									<p>Additionally, I serve as a research apprentice at the <strong>TigerSec Laboratory</strong> at Clemson University, where I explore cybersecurity challenges and secure system design.</p>

									<p>My research has resulted in publications at leading conferences including the <strong>Human Factors and Ergonomics Society (HFES) Annual Meeting</strong> and the <strong>Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)</strong> Spring Symposium Series. I've also contributed to international journals focused on AI applications in healthcare.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Beyond Research</h2>
									<p>When I'm not immersed in research or coding, you can find me:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Exploring the Makerspace:</strong> I previously worked at the Clemson University Makerspace, where I helped students bring their ideas to life using 3D printers, laser cutters, embroidery machines, and more. I also maintained the cumaker.space website and organized workshops to make technology accessible to everyone.</li>
										<li><strong>Building Things:</strong> Whether it's award-winning satellite monitoring platforms at hackathons (NASA Space Apps 2025 Winner!) or interactive portfolio websites, I love transforming ideas into tangible creations.</li>
										<li><strong>Learning Languages:</strong> Both human languages (English, German) and programming languages fascinate me. The art of clear communication—whether with people or computers—is something I constantly work to master.</li>
										<li><strong>Giving Back:</strong> Community service and mentorship are important to me. I believe technology should be accessible, and I'm passionate about helping others discover their own potential in computing.</li>
									</ul>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
									<p>I'm always eager to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of human-AI interaction, especially those with real-world impact. Whether it's advancing autonomous systems, protecting user privacy, or applying AI to solve pressing social challenges, I'm driven by the belief that technology should serve humanity thoughtfully and responsibly.</p>
